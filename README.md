# C\# OOP Teamwork Assignment - .NET Alpha Jul'18

## General Requirements
Please define and implement the following object-oriented assets in your project:

- At least **5 interfaces** (with one or more implementations)
- At least **15 classes** (implementing the application logic)
- At least **3 abstract classes** (with inheritors)
- At least **1 custom exception class** (with usage in your code)
- At least **3 levels of depth in inheritance**
- At least **1 polymorphism usage**
- At least **1 structure**
- At least **1 enumeration**
- At least **1 event** (with subscribers)
- At least **1 design pattern** (e.g. Composite, Singleton, Factory, Wrapper, Bridge, Command,  etc.)

You might read about design patterns in Wikipedia, Sourcemaking, DoFactory and others.

## Additional Requirements
- Follow the **best practices for OO design**: use data encapsulation, use exception handling properly, use delegates and events, use inheritance, abstraction and polymorphism properly, follow the principles of strong cohesion and loose coupling
- Obligatory use Git to keep your source code and for team collaboration 
- Provide a class diagram (to visualize all types)

## Optional Requirements
If you have a chance, time and a suitable situation, you might add some of the following to your project:

- Static members (fields, properties, constructor, etc.)
- Constants, generic types, indexers, operators overloading
- Lambda expressions and LINQ
- Implementation of `IEnumerable<T>`, `ICloneable`, `ToString()` override
- Namespaces (if your classes are too many)
- User interface (UI) – console, desktop, web, mobile or as you like it the most

## Non-Required Work
- Completely finished project is not obligatory required. It will not be a big problem if your project is not completely finished or is not working greatly. This team work project is for educational purpose. Its main purpose it to experience object-oriented modeling and OOP in a real-world project and to get some experience in team working and team collaboration with Git.

## Deliverables
- The complete source code.
- Brief documentation of your project in **.md**(markdown). It should provide the following information (in brief):
  - Team name and list of team members (with http://telerikacademy.com usernames)
  - Project purpose – what problem do you solve and how?
  - Class diagram of your types
  - The URL of your Git repository
  - Any other information (optionally)
- Obligatory upload your projects in the Showcase system (http://best.telerikacademy.com/)
- Optionally provide a PowerPoint presentation designed for the project defense

# C\# High Quality Code & Design Patterns Teamwork Assignment - .NET Alpha Jul'2018

## General Requirements

Please define and implement the following in your project:

- The **OOP** principles (where applicable)
  - Inheritance
  - Encapsulation
  - Abstraction
  - Polymorphism

- The **SOLID** principles (where applicable)
  - Single responsibility
  - Open/closed
  - Liskov substitution
  - Interface segregation
  - Dependency inversion

- Dependency inversion container (using Autofac)
  - Favor composition over inheritance
  - Introduce object lifetime management
  - Introduce convention based binding

- Unit tests
  - Unisolated tests will be looked upon as **invalid**!
  - Each member must introduce **at least 10** unit tests that use **both**:
    - **MSTest** (or other testing framework)
    - **Moq** (or other mocking framework)

- Project managment
  - Use a Kanban board to organize your work (Trello, for example)
  - Try to estimate each user story by writing down expected time, actual time and optionally story points.
  - Active team communication is the key to success!


## Additional Requirements
